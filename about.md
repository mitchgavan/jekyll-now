So you've stumbled across my website, welcome! It's been a little while since I originally launched this version of my site, so my about page was looking a little outdated and in need of an update.

I'm currently working as a front-end developer at [Isobar](http://www.isobar.com/au/en/) in Melbourne. Isobar is a digital agency with over 85 locations across the world, and boasts one of the largest front-end development teams in Melbourne. It's great to be able to work with so many other people passionate about the same field on a daily basis.

I haven't been writing as much as I'd like to as of late, mainly due to my other side project - [Console Brawl]({{ site.baseurl }}/work/console-brawl). But now that it's been launched (and is available on the app store), I hope to get back into more writing.

If you have a question or would like to say hi, feel free to get in touch with me via the links below. I hope you enjoy the site!
