I’ve helped build a wide range of digital products with an array of teams for over 10 years now. I’m most enthusiastic about the challenge of building complex web applications, that are both highly performant and user friendly. All whilst maintaining a codebase and team environment that others are delighted to work within.

I have experience working across the full-stack in a variety of languages and frameworks. Right now I'm enjoying building user interfaces with React and TypeScript. When it comes to the server side, I'm quite fond of Elixir with Phoenix.

I’m currently working as a software engineer at [BetEasy](https://www.beteasy.com.au) in Melbourne.
