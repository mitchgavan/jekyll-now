        <title>Where do I begin?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new website! I&amp;#39;ve finally managed to get my own blog up and running. Because seriously, what kind of person who creates for the web doesn&amp;#39;t have one? Anyway, I hope the content on here helps other developers/designers in some way or another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’ll introduce myself a little; I’m currently working as a front-end developer at the Fernwood Fitness head office in Melbourne. We have a great IT team that is working on multiple customer facing and internal projects at this time. Working along side a number of experienced professionals for around two years now, has allowed me to improve my skills immensely. When I first joined the team I could barely score a point in the table tennis games - now each game is an intensely fought battle down to the wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of our projects we follow the agile development process. From the estimation sessions to the code reviews it is a pretty well structured development environment that is gratifying to be a part of. It is also where I was first introduced to a Github workflow and have never looked back. This site is built with Github&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aim to write about some of the interesting projects/challenges/techniques I work on at my day job and beyond as a front-end developer. And while I’m not exactly sure what I’ll be putting on here, I’m excited to see how it evolves, and hope to give a little back to this great community that has inspired and taught me so much over the years!&lt;/p&gt;
